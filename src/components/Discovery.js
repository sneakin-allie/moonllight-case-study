                <h3>Man Management</h3>
                <p>Sketches, re-sketches, and wireframes ruled the discover process as we worked to define an experience that combined lineups, stats, and more tables than you could shake a corner flag at.</p>
                <h3>Achievable Scope</h3>
                <p>With a hard start-of-season deadline on one side and endless ideas on the other, we worked closely with the Moonllight team to keep a manageable wishlist.</p>
                <h3>Scoring Tune Ups</h3>
                <p>Choosing point values for player actions is no small feat. Early in the process, we added a simplified player selection took, allowing the client to check their numbers against performances in the previous season.</p>
